**Classification of Animal Species Using Transfer Learning**

The project aims to develop an efficient image classifier for accurately identifying and predicting animal species from images, utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This initiative is driven by the need to enhance wildlife monitoring and conservation efforts, which are currently hampered by manual, time-consuming species identification processes. By automating this task, the project aims to facilitate better monitoring of animal migration patterns and habitat usage, leading to more effective conservation strategies. The approach involves comprehensive image preprocessing, including resizing, grayscale conversion, and cropping to focus on the animals. Data augmentation techniques, such as rotation and flipping, are employed to expand the dataset. The project leverages pre-trained CNN architectures, namely VGG-16, ResNet50, and Inceptionv3, and uses transfer learning to fine-tune these models on the Animals-10 dataset from Kaggle, which contains images of ten different animal species. This dataset's diversity and quality enhance the model's ability to generalize across different contexts. The final model demonstrates high accuracy, aroung 97.81%, in species classification, showcasing the potential of these advanced techniques in revolutionizing wildlife monitoring by providing a robust tool for automated species recognition, thereby supporting ecological research and conservation efforts effectively.

**Distributed Recommendation System**

The project focuses on developing a recommender system that integrates both user ratings and reviews for making more accurate and scalable recommendations. This is motivated by the increasing need for effective data handling in e-commerce and big data contexts, where traditional recommendation methods struggle with large volumes of diverse data. The system employs various advanced techniques, including collaborative filtering and sentiment analysis, and utilizes distributed computing for efficient processing. Specifically, it integrates methods like Alternating Least Squares (ALS) for matrix factorization and applies sentiment analysis using word embeddings and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The architecture includes a combination of content-based filtering and collaborative filtering to enhance recommendation accuracy. The dataset used is the Amazon Review Dataset from 2018, containing 233.1 million reviews across various product categories, providing comprehensive user feedback in the form of ratings and detailed reviews. The final results demonstrate the system's improved performance in recommendation accuracy, surpassing traditional models by effectively utilizing both numerical ratings and textual review data. We got an average RMSE score of < 1 considering multiple datasets. This hybrid approach, coupled with sentiment analysis, allows for more personalized and precise recommendations, catering to the nuanced preferences of users.

**Index Fund Using Integer Programming**

In this project, we designed an Index fund to track the NASDAQ-100 index using an integer program and a linear program to pick stocks and allocate weights respectively. The performance of the index fund was evaluated for different values of m and compared to the NASDAQ-100 index. The goal was to find a practical and cost-effective way to create an index fund that mirrors the broad market.

**Car Brands Consumer Perception Analysis**

In this project, we analyzed user-generated content from the Edmunds car review forum to understand consumer perceptions of car brands. We used natural language processing techniques and visualized the results with a Multidimensional Scaling plot. Our analysis revealed the top 10 car brands, the attributes associated with those brands, and the most desired brand from the discussions. The insights from this project can inform marketing strategies for car brands.
