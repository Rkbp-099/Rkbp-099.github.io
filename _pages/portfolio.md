**Classification of Animal Species Using Transfer Learning**

The project involves the development of an image classifier using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automate the identification and prediction of animal species from images. The objective is to enhance wildlife monitoring and conservation efforts by streamlining species recognition processes. Manual identification, which is labor-intensive, necessitates automated systems capable of accurately classifying species. CNNs such as VGG-16, ResNet50, and Inceptionv3 were utilized, with transfer learning employed for efficient model training on the Animals-10 dataset sourced from Kaggle. This dataset includes diverse images of ten animal species, ensuring robust model training. The approach includes rigorous image preprocessing, data augmentation, and model fine-tuning, resulting in high classification accuracy, aroung 97.81%, across different contexts. This project underscores the transformative potential of machine learning in ecological research and wildlife conservation, offering a practical solution for real-time species monitoring and habitat management.

**Distributed Recommendation System**

The project develops a recommendation system that combines user ratings and reviews for accurate recommendations. This addresses the limitations of traditional methods in handling large and diverse data in e-commerce and big data contexts. It utilizes collaborative filtering, sentiment analysis, and distributed computing, specifically applying methods like Alternating Least Squares (ALS) and natural language processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis. The system employs a hybrid architecture integrating content-based and collaborative filtering. It uses the Amazon Review Dataset from 2018, which includes 233.1 million reviews across various products. The final system outperforms traditional models by effectively incorporating both ratings and textual data, providing more personalized and precise recommendations. Achieved average RMSE score of < 1 considering multiple datasets

**Stock Price Predictor**

The project develops a real-time stock prediction system forecasting 15-minute interval prices using historical data and technical indicators like Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP). Motivated by the complexity of predicting stock prices influenced by global factors, it aims to create an accurate model for short-term fluctuations. Employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and ARIMAX, the methodology includes data normalization and feature extraction. Historical intraday data from the US stock markets, accessed via the AlphaVantage API, serves as the dataset. The final model, integrating technical indicators and historical prices, demonstrates improved predictive accuracy, providing valuable insights for financial trading

**Text Summarizer**

This project focuses on text summarization, exploring both extractive and abstractive techniques. The extractive approach uses BERT and K-Means clustering to select key sentences from the original text. The abstractive method employs an encoder-decoder model with attention to generate new summary text. Both techniques are implemented, tested, and compared using various datasets. The project covers the entire process from data preparation and model development to performance evaluation, aiming to create efficient automatic summarization tools that can handle large volumes of text data. The ultimate goal is to produce concise, coherent summaries that save time and reduce bias in information consumption.
