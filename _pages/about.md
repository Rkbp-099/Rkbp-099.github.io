<br>Hi there, I'm Saurabh. <br>

I am a seasoned Analytics and Data Science professional with 3 years of experience in the industry. My expertise spans across Machine Learning, Deep Learning, MLOps Statistical Modeling, Reporting, Data Visualization and Data Wrangling. I’ve delivered impactful results for clients in various sectors like Banking and Insurance, to name a few. Additionally, I have experience in Bigdata Analytics, as I worked for Corridor Platforms (an EXL Service Company) to transfer SAS models for a large US bank to PySpark with 99.9% accuracy.

I hold a B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering and am currently pursuing MS in Business Analytics from UT Austin - McCombs School of Business. My curriculum includes cutting-edge courses like Deep Learning, Advance Machine Learning, Optimimzation, Unsupervised Learning, Demand/Pricing Analytics, and Social Media Analytics and a capstone project with Microsoft. With skills in Python, SQL, tableau, Java, Pytorch and more, I’m eager to take on challenging Data Science and Analytics projects. 

I am now seeking full-time opportunities in this field.
